# My language and binary translator in JIT implementation

## Background

This repository consists of several works I've done during the 1st grade programming cource of [Ilya Dedinsky](https://github.com/ded32)
in MIPT DREC. The first one, [Processor](https://github.com/lednikita0481/Language/tree/main/backend/Processor) was implemented to understand 
the main principles of computer's work with help of simulation of the translation from assembler to byte code and its execution.

Some tasks later Language was implemented. It's possible to write something in it and after that it will be translated to our hand-made assembler. 
Then assembler translates the code to byte-code for our processor and it can be executed. Language consists of two subtasks. Firstly in 
[frontend](https://github.com/lednikita0481/Language/tree/main/frontend) the program is parsing my language code into the nodes tree 
and writes it to the file according to the [tree standart](https://github.com/dodokek/LanguageStandart/blob/main/README.md). After that 
[middlend part](https://github.com/lednikita0481/Language/tree/main/middlend) translates it to the assembly. Such division made our languages
"multi-platform": you can give your tree-standart file to another student, and your code will be executable on his realization of processor and vice versa.

Final task is a [binary translator](https://github.com/lednikita0481/Language/tree/main/JIT). It helps to make the code, written in my programming language, executable on a real machine. 

After the end of MIPT session I will add more detailed README about the language and to improve it a bit, but now I've described only binary translation.



## Binary Translation (JIT version)

My [program](https://github.com/lednikita0481/Language/tree/main/JIT) takes the binary code, generated by our assembler implemetation, translates it to x86-64 machine code and executes. For this purpose JIT uses specially allocated buffer. With help of *mprotect* the buffer gets execution rights and after that can be called as an average C function. 

To build the programm, you can put the binary file to the *programs* folder and write еру file name as a command line argument, for example: 
~~~ 
~./JIT factorial.prog
~~~

Or, if you want to see coming all the way from my language code to execution on x86-64 machine, put language code in file "/frontend/lang_code/code.txt" and call 
~~~ 
~ make run
~~~
in the main directory. In that way program will be executed twice: firstly on my Processor, secondly on x86-64 machine after the binary translation.

### Translation

Here you can see how commands are translated from my assebler to x86-64:

  <summary>Translation of Push & Pop </summary>
  
  | My assembler  |  x86-64 assembler           |   Comments               |
  | :-----------: | :-------------------------: | :----------------------: |
  | push [mem]    | push [r15 + mem]            | r15 - buffer begin       |
  | push num      | mov rax, num <br> push rax  | no command to push constant |
  | pop [mem]     | pop  [r15 + mem]            |r15 - buffer begin       |
  
  During language to asm translation process no other push & pop variations were used (that's not perfect and I will change it soon)

  In every argument we replace the absolute ip in the old byte code with a relative offset to the call address.

Firstly I translate given byte-code comands to structures, making so-called IR (Intermediate representation). It helps to translate byte code much easier, makes debugging more convenient and code more readable.
