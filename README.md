# My language and binary translator in JIT implementation

## Background

This repository consists of several works I've done during the 1st-grade programming course of [Ilya Dedinsky](https://github.com/ded32)
in MIPT DREC. The first one, [Processor](https://github.com/lednikita0481/Language/tree/main/backend/Processor), was implemented to understand 
the main principles of the computer's work with the help of simulation of the translation from assembler to byte code and its execution.

Some tasks later Language was implemented. It's possible to write something in it and after that, it will be translated to our hand-made assembler. 
Then assembler translates the code to byte-code for our processor and it can be executed. Language consists of two subtasks. Firstly in 
[frontend](https://github.com/lednikita0481/Language/tree/main/frontend) the program is parsing my language code into the nodes tree 
and writes it to the file according to the [tree standard](https://github.com/dodokek/LanguageStandart/blob/main/README.md). After that 
[middlend part](https://github.com/lednikita0481/Language/tree/main/middlend) translates into to the assembly. Such division made our languages
"multi-platform": you can give your tree-standart file to another student, and your code will be executable on his realization of the processor and vice versa.

The final task is a [binary translator](https://github.com/lednikita0481/Language/tree/main/JIT). It helps to make the code, written in my programming language, executable on a real machine. 

After the end of the MIPT session I will add a more detailed README about the language and improve it a bit, but now I've described only binary translation.



## Binary Translation (JIT version)

My [program](https://github.com/lednikita0481/Language/tree/main/JIT) takes the binary code, generated by our assembler implementation, translates it to x86-64 machine code and executes it. For this purpose, JIT uses specially a allocated buffer. With the help of *mprotect* the buffer gets execution rights and after that can be called as an average C function. 

To build the program, you can put the binary file in the *programs* folder and write еру file name as a command line argument, for example: 
~~~ 
~./JIT factorial.prog
~~~

Or, if you want to see coming all the way from my language code to execution on x86-64 machine, put the language code in file "/frontend/lang_code/code.txt" and call 
~~~ 
~ make run
~~~
in the main directory. In that way program will be executed twice: firstly on my Processor, secondly on x86-64 machine after the binary translation.

### Translation

Here you can see how commands are translated from my assembler to x86-64:

<details>
  <summary>Translation of Push & Pop </summary>
  
  | My assembler  |  x86-64 assembler           |   Comments               |
  | :-----------: | :-------------------------: | :----------------------: |
  | push [mem]    | push [r15 + mem]            | r15 - buffer begin       |
  | push num      | mov rax, num <br> push rax  | no command to push constant |
  | pop [mem]     | pop  [r15 + mem]            |r15 - buffer begin       |
  
  During language to asm translation process no other push & pop variations were used (that's not perfect and I will change it soon)

  <summary>Translation of jumps and call </summary>

  | cond_jmp      | pop rbx <br> pop rax <br> cmp rax, rbx <br> cond_jmp  |
  
  In every argument we replace the absolute ip in the old byte code with a relative offset to the call address.

Firstly I translate given byte-code commands to structures, making so-called IR (Intermediate representation). It helps to translate byte code much easier, makes debugging more convenient and code more readable.


## Performance analyzing

Now we can compare the performance on hand-made processor and on real x86-64 architecture. In the time-test regime, all outputs are shut down and inputs are replaced for receiving a fixed number. The program is executed 10000000 times. You can change these parameters in "common_define.h"

**Factorial**:
- The program counts 7!
- My Processor execution time: 7.48 s
- x86_64 execution time: 0.92 s
- Speed up: 8.1 times

**Quadratic equation solver**:
- The programm counts $x^2 + 4x + 3 = 0$
- My Processor execution time: 6.38 s
- x86_64 execution time: 0.91 s
- Speed up: 7.0 times

## Conclusion 

During the implementation of these works, I learned a lot about computer architecture, compilators and programming. In the nearest future, after the session end, I'm planning to improve my program, add some optimizations and implement more functions. I give all the thanks to Ded, aka Dedus, aka Ilya Dedinskiy, and to all my groupmates for this really interesting and productive year! Hope to continue our journey together!
